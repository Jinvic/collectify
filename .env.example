# .env.example

# Example environment variables for configuring the Collectify application
# To use these, copy this file to `.env` and modify the values as needed.
# Docker Compose will automatically load this `.env` file.
# Your Go application (using Viper) will read these environment variables.

# --- Database Configuration ---
# Database type (e.g., sqlite, mysql, postgres)
COLLECTIFY_DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite

# Data Source Name for the database
# For SQLite, this is typically a file path.
# When running in Docker, consider using a path within a mounted volume for persistence,
# e.g., /root/data/collectify.db, and ensure the host directory (./data) exists.
COLLECTIFY_DATABASE_DSN=./data/collectify.db

# --- Server Configuration ---
# Port on which the server will listen
COLLECTIFY_SERVER_PORT=8080

# Server mode (e.g., release, debug)
# 'debug' mode in Gin provides detailed logging
# 'release' mode is optimized for production
COLLECTIFY_SERVER_MODE=release

# --- Recycle Bin Feature ---
# Enable or disable the recycle bin feature
# Set to true or false
COLLECTIFY_RECYCLEBIN_ENABLE=false
